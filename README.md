Joddla - JobXML to DXF Converter
================================

Abstract
--------

Joddla is a desktop software tool that converts Trimble JobXML files containing surveyed
data points to line and arc segments in a DXF file. It is a replacement and improvement
over the DXF export stylesheet available for the Trimble field computer.

Features
--------

The software currently features the following:

 * Converts the reduced data points from the JobXML file to points in a new DXF file.
 * Fits arcs to curve data points, instead of producing polylines.
 * Can convert large data sets without any problem.
 
Status
------

Software holds beta quality, and is deemed good enough for production use.

Limitations:

 * Assumes that a correct grid has been input into the field computer, no reprojections or similar are done.
 * Only tested with data points collected in Sweden.

If you use this software, or have suggestions on how to improve it, please file an issue!
